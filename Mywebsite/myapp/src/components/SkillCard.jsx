// Hey Copilot, Iâ€™m working on a full-stack skill-sharing platform built with React on the frontend and Iâ€™m now adding a Node.js + Express + MongoDB backend.

// Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve done so far:

// âœ… Frontend:
// - Built with React and Tailwind CSS
// - Theme toggle (light/dark) using context
// - AuthContext handles login/logout and stores user in localStorage
// - Navbar shows different links based on login state
// - Register page allows users to enter name, email, password, bio, and select multiple skills (with react-select)
// - Profile page displays user info and skills, and allows deleting skills
// - Add Skill page lets logged-in users add a new skill (with type: teach/learn)
// - SkillList (Browse Skills) page:
//   - Shows all users and their skills
//   - Supports search and filtering by skill type
//   - Allows rating skills with stars (using react-icons)
//   - I want to add a comment system per skill

// ðŸ§© What I want to build next:
// - A backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
// - User registration and login (with JWT or sessions)
// - Store users, skills, ratings, and comments in MongoDB
// - API routes for:
//   - Register/login
//   - Get all skills
//   - Add/delete skills
//   - Rate a skill
//   - Comment on a skill
// - Connect frontend to backend via Axios or fetch

// Please help me continue from here. You can ask me for any missing details or generate the backend structure and code step by step.
